# Honey

Honey is currently a simple and sweet async runtime for learning purposes.

Tokio is wonderful, and all the great work the Tokio team is appreciated! But I want to learn async from the ground-up in Rust, and so this project is to help me understand async Rust!

Right now it doesn't really work, but hoping to get there!
